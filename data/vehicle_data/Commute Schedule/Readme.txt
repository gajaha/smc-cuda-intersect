Commute schedules are extracted from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey which is published here: https://nhts.ornl.gov/

We filtered down the data to commute trips in Chicago which are from home to work, and from work to home. These are provided as separate files.
Each file contains the fraction of trips per hour (row) for each day of the week (column).
