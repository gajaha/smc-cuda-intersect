For your convenience, we provide a subset of these building footprints that is clipped to the area which contains road data. You can download the full Illinois dataset (almost 5 million buildings) here: https://usbuildingdata.blob.core.windows.net/usbuildings-v1-1/Illinois.zip (over 1 GB unzipped).
This subset is in GeoJSON format and can be read using a json library.
